Not sure where this is going to go, yet.
My goal is to collect the massive amount of resources regarding interactive programming I've come across into a single location.
We could start this process by defining the categories for each item from "Visualization and Discovery," to "Manipulation and Experimentation,"
Almost everything is in the category of "Languages & Development Environments"

I'm currently reading the book _Curious_ by Ian Leslie for inspiration around the structure. I'd like to map the goals and organization strategy of this book to the writing I'm attempting to do, here.

Dynamicland is a computing environment for teaching, sharing, and experimenting with computation.
<!-- Show don't tell -->
Key activities at dynamicland include
  visualizing data across a map,
  combining programs which interact with the computations,
  and creating games.

## Origins

Several projects predate dynamicland including
